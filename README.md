# ðŸ©» MedMod: A Multimodal Benchmark for Clinical Prediction Tasks with Electronic Health Records and Chest X-Ray Images

Overview
============
This GitHub repository hosts the official website for the MedMod leaderboard, a benchmark designed to evaluate and compare performance across unimodal and multimodal clinical models trained on the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets. MedMod gathers an overview of current state-of-the-art models, enabling researchers to track the progress of both unimodal and multimodal approaches in: prediction of clinical conditions, in-hospital mortality, decompensation, length of stay, readmission, and radiological findings. We perform extensive evaluations of six supervised learning models, encompassing basic fusion paradigms (early, joint, late) and other sophisticated multimodal frameworks. We also evaluate three state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods and present a unified evaluation scheme and protocol for each task. The leaderboard allows users to explore detailed results for each model and submit their own work for consideration. By submitting new results, researchers can contribute to an evolving repository of knowledge fostering transparency and reproducibility in healthcare model development.
